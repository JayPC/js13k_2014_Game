This game is a side scrolling shooter that combines the theme "The 4 Elements" 

This was a really simple prototype and I didn't manage to finish the game, movement and shooting is there but there isn't much else due to lack of time. Enemies don't spawn and don't colide or get destroyed by bullets. 

The original concept was basically:
Water beats Fire, Fire beats Air, Air beats Earth, Earth beats Water. The bullets deal bonus damage against the opposing type and half damage against the same type. 

Controls are:

QWER - Change the ship type. this changes the type of bullet that is shot.
Space - shoot the gun.
Arrow Keys - Move the ship.
